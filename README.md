Becoming a better writer through LLM usage

## The Story

I'm a blogger.  I like to write.  I enjoy the storytelling, the crafting of a phrase to share the weight of an idea with my reader.  What I'm _not_ always good at is writing for SEO (Search Engine Optimization).  Oh, I can share a great story, but getting the algorithms to recognize that story and promote it to a wider audience effectively isn't always easy.

`lz` is designed to use LLMs for stuff they're good for - reviewing and cleaning up.
